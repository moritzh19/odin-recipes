<h1>Long Island Ice Tea</h1>

<p><h2>Description:</h2></p>
<p><strong>The Long Island Iced Tea was popularized in the 1970s and remains a beloved drink. It’s possible the cocktail was born out of Prohibition, when thirsty scofflaws wanted to disguise their booze. It’s also possible the drink sprung up in the ’70s at a bar in Long Island, or maybe at a TGI Friday’s. This much is known: You still can’t throw a lemon wedge inside the chain restaurant without knocking one over.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On paper, the Long Island Iced Tea is one hot mess of a drink. Four different—and disparate—spirits slugging it out in a single glass, along with triple sec, lemon juice and cola? The recipe reads more like a frat-house hazing ritual than one of the world’s most popular cocktails. And yet, somehow, it works.</strong></p>
