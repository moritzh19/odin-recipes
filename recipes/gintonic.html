    <p><h2>Description:</h2></p>
    <p><strong>Classic and easy, the gin and tonic is light and refreshing. It's a simple mixed drink that requires just the two named ingredients and a hint of lime, all of which are natural flavor companions. This is a great choice for happy hour, dinner, or anytime you simply want an invigorating beverage.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The best gin and tonic is made with a quality gin, especially those with a slight citrus flavor and a great blend of botanicals. Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray are two brands that will always be G&T favorites. It also stands up to many of the less expensive gins, which is why it's an excellent cocktail to turn to when you want to save a little money. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>One thing to keep in mind is that your gin and tonic is only as good as both the gin and the tonic. Explore some of the great tonic waters that have sprung up thanks to this drink's resurgence in popularity. Q Drinks and Fever-Tree are two soda brands worth checking out because they were designed specifically for mixed drinks like this.</strong></p>
